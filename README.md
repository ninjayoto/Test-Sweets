Test Sweets
======================
### A boilerplate test suite for automated Javascript tests.

Test Sweets is designed to be a portable, flexible, and easy to understand approach to: automating javascript tests in the browser.

It lives neatly in its own polite folder, sitting carefully as not to disturb the rest of your app, but unlocks a powerful timesaver and fascinating programming challenge.

#### Should you read on, and use Test Sweets in your web application, you will receive the following benefits:

- Constant immediate feedback on the state of your application
- An early warning system that catches the worst kind of bugs: silent failures
- A greater sense of confidence when making changes to your codebase
- A goal in life.

#### Additional technical features.

- List of sample assertions available in the qUnit test framework
- A sample test runner for rapid cross browser testing
- Configurations for integrating Grunt
- Testing at the command line using PhantomJS

### Testing Philosophy

Testing front-end code in web applications is not as straight forward as one would assume. It is very possible to write poor, brittle tests, that cost more time to maintain than any advantages gained from automated testing.

Just like how writing clean and effective code adheres to concepts like "Seperation of Concerns" and "Dont Repeat Yourself", your testing philosophy will determine the quality of your test suite.

#### Testing Principles

 - Every test must be atomic.

 - A test should be fast. 

 - Write once, run forever
